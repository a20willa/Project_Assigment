# Project Assigment
An application that uses JSON data from the server side and adds it to an interactive list.
## About App
The app is meant for the community of physical actvity, meaning walking, running, jogging, etc. There are multiple tags outside which the user is supposed to look for and scan. based on some clues provided by the app. These tags grant "points" which you can use, although this concept is not implemented inside of the app. This is the basic concept.
## GitHub Commits
Commits have been made for a duration of two or three weeks. These commits have updated the app to it's current state, but two of the commits can be considered a mistake: *

 - *9969297b5cf26fc92469b1b410e02a5e2d0f280d*
 - *65ebb2bccb71ae8492191cef3fcb4facf5fe292c*

These two have the same update text as a previous commit, and should be ignored as they were not meant to be commited in this manor. Neither do they contain any useful update or such. I do not have the knowledge to delete, nor do I dare to delete any commits as things could go very wrong, something I do not want to risk. Thus, they are kept.
